Basic health check, always returns `200` if the server is running.

### GET `/api/v1/fizz-buzz`

This endpoint returns a JSON list of strings with numbers from 1 to `limit`, where:
all multiples of `int1` are replaced by `str1`, all multiples of `int2` are replaced
by `str2`, all multiples of `int1` and `int2` are replaced by `str1str2`.

It accepts the following query parameters:

* `int1` - required, non-zero positive integer
* `int2` - required, non-zero positive integer
* `limit` - required, non-zero positive integer
* `str1` - a string
* `str2` - a string

### GET `/api/v1/stats`

This endpoint returns a JSON object with the parameters of the most frequent request and
the number of occurrences of this request.

<details>
    <summary>Example (200 OK)</summary>

```json

```
</details>

ðŸ“£ Current implementation of this endpoint relies on an in memory data source.
In other words, the statistics are not persisted between runs nor are they relevant
in a distributed environment.

However, one may provide its own data source implementation by implementing the
`stats.Statitistics` interface. Suitable data sources could be either No-SQL or SQL.
For the latter, the implementer will have to make sure the requests' parameters do not
lead to SQL injection (e.g., `str1` equals `DROP TABLE foo;`).
